  description: In 2020, we received funding from the [Royal Society of New Zealand Marsden Fund](https://www.royalsociety.org.nz/what-we-do/funds-and-opportunities/marsden) to develop our preliminary research into how the skin microbiome of _Xenopus_ tadpoles can be manipulated and how it affects regenerative outcomes, in collaboration with Dr Xochitl Morgan (Microbiology and Immunology) and Dr Robert Day (Biochemistry). Dr Phoebe Chapman is our postdoctoral fellow on this project, and leads the work. The project also involved research assistant Dan Hudson and former lab students Campbell Gilbert and Thomas Devine. Campbell was able to show that LPS extracted from commensal and non-commensal bacteria had similar effects in increasing the chances of tail regeneration. Tom isolated and sequenced the microbiomes of tadpoles raised in antibiotic (which regenerate less well) to those raised naturally (which regenerate better). Our first study was published in the journal Wound Repair and Regeneration as [Chapman et al, 2022](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/wrr.13003) A preprint of our recent work [The role of family and environment in determining the skin microbiome of captive aquatic frogs, _Xenopus laevis_](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.10.05.561135v1) shows how the tadpole skin becomes colonised.

  description: We are delighted to have been awarded a second Project Grant from the [Neurological Foundation](https://neurological.org.nz/) which will enable us to continue to develop our tadpole model to study _de novo_ variants (not inherited from parents) that cause these devastating and largely untreatable early onset seizure disorders. This project is collaboration with fellow Zoology researchers Drs. Paul Szyszka and Bart Guerten, and Dr. Sulagna Banerjee will be rejoining the lab as the lead researcher.
DEE are a diverse group of genetic disorders characterised by the onset of difficult-to-treat seizures in the first year of life, leading to developmental regression or stalling. Globally, clinical "gene hunters" have identified over 100 genes linked to DEE, but functional studies to determine why variants in these genes lead to seizures are failing to keep pace. _Xenopus_ tadpoles make good models for human disorders, and we will continue to model NZ patient specific variants using CRISPR/Cas9. We are also developing better tools to characterise tadpole behaviour, brain development and function, with a long term aim to developing models for rapid drug screening.
