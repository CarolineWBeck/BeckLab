Sandesh was the ARF on our 2021 Neurological Foundation funded project, developing new pre-clinical models for DEE (developmental and epileptic encephalopathy). Originally from Nepal, Sandesh found his way to Dunedin via South Korea. His PhD work in the Department of Anatomy also focussed on epilepsy. He used molecular genetics, behavioural analysis software and electrophysiology in our tadpole models to replicate human variants in _Cyfip2_ that associate with DEE. Sandesh is now working as a postdoctoral fellow in Australia.
