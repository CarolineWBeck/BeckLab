Sulagna is from Kolkata in India and has an MSc in Medical Genetics from University of Glasgow (Scotland). She gained her PhD in Genetics in 2023, where she developed tadpoles as a new model of intractable epilepsy and used them to test anti inflammatory compounds for their ability to reduce seizure activity. Her work involves CRISPR/Cas9 editing of DEE genes in tadpoles, behavioural analysis, drug testing and detection of brain activity.

Sulagna's research is co-supervised by Dr. Paul Szyszka who joined the Department of Zoology in 2019. Her postdoc work is funded by the [Neurological Foundation](https://neurological.org.nz/).
