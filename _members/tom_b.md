Tom did his undergraduate study in Biochemistry at Otago University and an Honours project with Prof. Iain Lamont. Tom then joined the Beck lab to pursue his PhD, in which he made some great progress towards understanding how regeneration is regulated by pathways that link wound response, inflammation, apoptosis and cell cycle. 

Tom also spent 7 months in Florida working with Profs Malcolm Maden and Paul Reier, where he applied his Xenopus findings to mammalian regeneration models. He is now a postdoc at University of California!
