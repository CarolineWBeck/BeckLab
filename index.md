# Beck Lab

Our lab uses tadpoles of the clawed frog _Xenopus laevis_ to study development and regeneration of appendages and to understand how mutations in over 100 genes lead to developmental and epilieptic encephalopathy (DEE) in humans.

Our lab is based in the [Zoology Department](https://www.otago.ac.nz/zoology) at the [University of Otago](https://www.otago.ac.nz/) in Dunedin, on _Te Waipounamu_, the south island of New Zealand.

We use molecular genetic, bioinformatic and neuroscience techniques to ask interesting questions about how animals develop from a single cell to a complex adult organism. Our current research is mainly focussed on two projects:
>
* Determining the role of the holobiont in tadpole tail regeneration, and how the microbiome is acquired, shaped and maintained.
* Developing pre-clinical models of genetic epilepsy (DEE) using CRISPR/Cas9 editing using _Xenopus_ tadpoles, with the aim of finding new targets for future therapies.
