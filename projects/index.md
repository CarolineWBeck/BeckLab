The Beck lab uses molecular genetic techniques to study development and regeneration as well disease, using the _Xenopus_ model vertebrate organism. We have worked on limb, eye and tail development and  regeneration, and our current research follows two main themes. The first is an ongoing use of the tadpole tail, a complex appendage which regenerates spinal cord and muscle tissue, to study how interactions between commensal skin microbiota, inflammation, and innate immune system determine successful regenerative responses. More recently, we have been using CRISPR/Cas9 to generate _Xenopus_ tadpole models of DEE (developmental and epileptic encephalopathies), a genetically diverse group of early infantile epilepsies. These catastrophic developmental conditions, while individually rare, can be caused by pathogenic variants in over 100 genes.
